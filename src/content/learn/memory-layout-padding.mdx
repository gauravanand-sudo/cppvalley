# C++ Object Layout in Memory

This is **normal text**.
If this looks like code, something is wrong ❌.

C++ objects are not abstract — they are **bytes laid out in memory**.

## Simple Example

Here is an inline code example: `sizeof(int)`
This should look inline, **not like a block**.

## Basic C++ Struct

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```
